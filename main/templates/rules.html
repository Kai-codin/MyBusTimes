<h2 id="faq">FaQ</h2>

<div class="terms-text">
	<strong>Is MyBusTimes Related To bustimes.org?</strong><br><br>

	<p class="terms-sub-text">
		MyBusTimes is a completely independent product, developed without any affiliation, connection, or association
		with
		bustimes.org.<br><br>
		While MyBusTimes has been intentionally designed to have a similar visual style to bustimes.org, this
		resemblance is
		purely superficial and serves only to evoke a certain aesthetic.<br><br>
		MyBusTimes is a separate project, distinct in purpose and function, created solely for entertainment purposes
		and
		specifically designed to enable users to create custom fleet lists.<br><br>
		It is important to note that despite any similarities in appearance or design, MyBusTimes and bustimes.org are
		entirely unrelated, and the similarities do not imply any form of endorsement, sponsorship, or relationship
		between
		the two platforms.<br><br>
		MyBusTimes does not replicate, compete with, or infringe upon the services or content provided by bustimes.org,
		and
		any likeness is a matter of stylistic choice rather than substantive connection. <br>

</div>
<br>
<div class="terms-text">
	<strong>What is the purpose of MyBusTimes?</strong><br><br>
	<p class="terms-sub-text">
		MyBusTimes (MBT) is designed purely for recreational purposes, providing users with a platform to create and
		customize fleet lists for games or for personal enjoyment.<br><br>
		The tool allows users to add their companies to groups, edit their fleet lists, manage routes, and modify those
		routes as desired.<br><br>
		Essentially, MyBusTimes offers a fun and interactive way to engage with bus simulation and management, catering
		to
		enthusiasts who enjoy personalizing their virtual bus environments.

<h2 id="rules">Account Suspension and Ban Policy</h2>
<div class="terms-text">
	At MyBusTimes, we take violations of our rules seriously to ensure a safe and fair environment for all users.
	Depending on the severity and frequency of rule violations, we apply three levels of enforcement: Suspension, Ban,
	and IP Ban.
	<br><br>
	<strong>1. Suspension (Temporary / Short-Term)</strong>
	<p class="terms-sub-text">
		A suspension is a temporary restriction on an account, usually given as a first warning for minor rule
		violations. Suspended users may regain full access after the suspension period ends.
		<br><br>
		Common reasons for suspension include:<br>
		Minor rule violations<br>
		Spamming or excessive off-topic discussions<br>
		Inappropriate behavior that does not warrant a ban<br><br>
	</p>

	<strong>2. Ban (Long-Term Restriction)</strong>

	<p class="terms-sub-text">
		A ban is a more severe action applied to users who repeatedly violate our rules. Banned users lose access to
		their accounts for an extended period or indefinitely, depending on the circumstances.
		<br><br>
		Common reasons for a ban include:<br>
		Multiple suspensions for repeated offenses<br>
		Harassment, discrimination, or targeted abuse<br>
		Attempting to bypass moderation actions<br><br>
	</p>

	<strong>3. IP Ban (Permanent Ban)</strong>

	<p class="terms-sub-text">
		An IP Ban is a permanent restriction placed on both the user's account and their IP address. This is the
		strictest level of enforcement and is reserved for severe violations that compromise the safety and integrity of
		the community.
		<br><br>
		Common reasons for an IP ban include:<br>
		Creating multiple accounts to evade bans ("Alting")<br>
		Engaging in illegal or highly inappropriate behavior (e.g., contacting underage users)<br>
		Significant threats, hacking attempts, or malicious activity<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<strong>Ban Revocation Policy</strong>
	<br>
	<p class="terms-sub-text">
		If a temporary suspension or long-term ban is lifted, users may regain access to their account and content.
		However, if a permanent ban (IP ban) is revoked, the user will not regain any previously removed content and
		must start fresh.
	</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
	By using MyBusTimes, you agree to abide by these policies. We reserve the right to enforce appropriate actions at
	our discretion to maintain a safe and welcoming platform for all users.
